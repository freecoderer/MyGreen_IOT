## Project Goals
- **Enhanced Plant Care**: Provide users with a system that helps them monitor and manage the health of their plants effectively.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to interact with their plants through a web app, making plant care more engaging and educational.
- **Technology Integration**: Utilize embedded systems and modern web technologies to create a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track various environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and light levels to ensure optimal plant health.
- **User Alerts**: Notify users when their plants need water, light, or other care actions through the web app.
- **Interactive Display**: Use a display connected to the system to show the current status of the plant and interact with the user.
- **Voice Interaction**: Implement LLM (Large Language Model) to allow the plant to "speak" to the user, similar to a virtual assistant like GiGA Genie.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
### Embedded Systems
- **Raspberry Pi**: The central unit for processing data from various sensors and controlling the display.
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, light sensor to monitor environmental conditions.

### Frontend
- **Flutter**: For building a responsive and cross-platform web app interface.

### Backend
- **Python**: For processing sensor data and controlling the system logic.

### AI/ML
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: For implementing the voice interaction feature.

### Communication
- **Webcam**: To recognize the user and enhance interaction.

## Project Achievements
- **User Interaction**: Successfully developed a system where users can interact with their plants via a web app, receiving real-time data and alerts.
- **Voice Integration**: Implemented a voice interaction feature using LLM, allowing the plant to communicate with the user in a natural language.
- **Recognition**: Awarded at the Catholic University Capstone Design Competition (2023-01) for innovation in interactive plant management.

## Role and Contributions
- **Project Manager**: Led the project, coordinating between different team members and ensuring that milestones were met on time.
- **Embedded Developer**: Developed the embedded system using Raspberry Pi, integrating various sensors, and controlling the hardware components.
- **Frontend Developer**: Built the web app interface using Flutter, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
- **AI Developer**: Implemented the voice interaction feature using LLM, making the system more engaging and interactive for users.

## Key Learning and Impact
The My Green project allowed me to deepen my understanding of embedded systems and their integration with web technologies. I gained hands-on experience with Raspberry Pi and various sensors, enhancing my skills in hardware-software integration. The project also improved my ability to manage and coordinate a multidisciplinary team, from concept to execution. This experience has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to tackle complex IoT projects and drive innovation in the field of interactive systems.
